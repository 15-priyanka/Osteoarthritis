<h1 class="first" style="font-variant: uppercase;">Osteoarthritis</h1>
<h3><marquee>Osteoarthritis, also known as degenerative joint disease is the most common type of arthritis.</marquee></h3>

<img src="im.jpg" class="Image">

<h3 class="third">CAUSES</h3>
<p>Primary osteoarthritis is a heterogeneous disease meaning it has many different causes, it is not only “wear and tear” arthritis. Some contributing factors to OA are modifiable (can be changed) and others are non-modifiable (cannot be changed such as born with it or now permanent). Age is a contributing factor, although not all older adults develop osteoarthritis and for those who do, not all develop associated pain. As discussed above, there can also be inflammatory and metabolic risks that can increase the incidence of osteoarthritis, particularly in the setting of diabetes and/or elevated cholesterol.</p>
<p>Osteoarthritis can be genetic both as primary such as nodular OA of the hands as well as secondary related to other genetic disorders, such as hypermobility of joints. Inflammatory and infectious arthritis can contribute to the development of secondary osteoarthritis due to chronic inflammation and joint destruction. Previous injuries or traumas including sports-related and repetitive motions can also contribute to osteoarthritis.</p>

<p>Although the exact mechanisms of cartilage loss and bone changes are unknown, advancements have been made in recent years. It is suspected that complex signaling processes, during joint inflammation and defective repair mechanisms in response to injury, gradually wear down cartilage within the joints. Other changes cause the joint to lose mobility and function, resulting in joint pain with activity.</p>

<h3 class="third">DIAGNOSIS</h3>
<p>Unlike other types of arthritis, the pain from osteoarthritis usually develops gradually over many months or years. Often it increases with activities that put stress on the joint, such as running or prolonged walking. Pain and joint swelling tend to increase slowly over time. Sometimes, especially in more advanced disease, a sensation of crunching or grinding may be noticed in affected joints. Prolonged morning stiffness is not a prominent symptom in OA as compared to inflammatory arthritides, such as rheumatoid or psoriatic arthritis. Osteoarthritis does not usually cause fevers, weight loss, or very hot and red joints. These features suggest some other condition or type of arthritis.</p>

<p>Your healthcare provider (MD, DO, NP, PA) can typically diagnose osteoarthritis by obtaining a complete history of your symptoms and examining your joints. X-rays may be helpful to make sure there is no other reason for the pain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is generally not needed except in unusual circumstances or in cases when the cartilage or surrounding ligament tear is suspected. There are no blood tests that diagnose osteoarthritis. If a joint is particularly swollen, a doctor may need to drain fluid from that joint. Tests can be performed on the fluid to look for clues for other types of arthritis, such as gout.</p>


	<h3 class="third">TREATMENTS</h3>
<p>Medical treatments include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Medications (topical pain medicines and oral analgesics including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications)</li>
<li>Exercise (land- and water-based).</li>
<li>Intermittent hot and cold packs (local modalities).</li>
<li>Physical, occupational, and exercise therapy.</li>
<li>Weight loss (if overweight).</li>
<li>Healthy eating, managing diabetes and cholesterol.</li>
<li>Supportive devices such as braces, orthotics, shoe inserts, cane, or walker.</li>
<li>Intra-articular injection therapies.</li>
<li>Complementary and alternative medicine strategies, including vitamins and supplements.</li>
</ul>
